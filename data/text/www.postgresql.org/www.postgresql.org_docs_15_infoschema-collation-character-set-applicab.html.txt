37.11. collation_character_set_​applicability



The view collation_character_set_applicability identifies which character set the available collations are applicable to. In PostgreSQL, there is only one character set per database (see explanation in Section 37.7), so this view does not provide much useful information.

Table 37.9. collation_character_set_applicability Columns








Column Type
Description






collation_catalog sql_identifier
Name of the database containing the collation (always the current database)




collation_schema sql_identifier
Name of the schema containing the collation




collation_name sql_identifier
Name of the default collation




character_set_catalog sql_identifier
Character sets are currently not implemented as schema objects, so this column is null




character_set_schema sql_identifier
Character sets are currently not implemented as schema objects, so this column is null




character_set_name sql_identifier
Name of the character set
