54.34. pg_user_mappings



The view pg_user_mappings provides access to information about user mappings. This is essentially a publicly readable view of pg_user_mapping that leaves out the options field if the user has no rights to use it.

Table 54.34. pg_user_mappings Columns








Column Type
Description






umid oid (references pg_user_mapping.oid)
OID of the user mapping




srvid oid (references pg_foreign_server.oid)
The OID of the foreign server that contains this mapping




srvname name (references pg_foreign_server.srvname)
Name of the foreign server




umuser oid (references pg_authid.oid)
OID of the local role being mapped, or zero if the user mapping is public




usename name
Name of the local user to be mapped




umoptions text[]
User mapping specific options, as “keyword=value” strings






To protect password information stored as a user mapping option, the umoptions column will read as null unless one of the following applies:



current user is the user being mapped, and owns the server or holds USAGE privilege on it


current user is the server owner and mapping is for PUBLIC


current user is a superuser
