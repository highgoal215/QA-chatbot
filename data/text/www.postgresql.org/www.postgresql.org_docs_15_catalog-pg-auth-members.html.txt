53.9. pg_auth_members



The catalog pg_auth_members shows the membership relations between roles. Any non-circular set of relationships is allowed.
Because user identities are cluster-wide, pg_auth_members is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_auth_members per cluster, not one per database.

Table 53.9. pg_auth_members Columns

ID of a role that is a member of roleid




grantor oid (references pg_authid.oid)
ID of the role that granted this membership
