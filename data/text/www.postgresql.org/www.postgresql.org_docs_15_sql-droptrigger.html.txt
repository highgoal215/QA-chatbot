DROP TRIGGER

DROP TRIGGER
DROP TRIGGER — remove a trigger


Synopsis

DROP TRIGGER [ IF EXISTS ] name ON table_name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP TRIGGER removes an existing trigger definition. To execute this command, the current user must be the owner of the table for which the trigger is defined.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the trigger does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name of the trigger to remove.

table_name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table for which the trigger is defined.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the trigger, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the trigger if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
Destroy the trigger if_dist_exists on the table films:

DROP TRIGGER if_dist_exists ON films;



Compatibility
The DROP TRIGGER statement in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL standard. In the SQL standard, trigger names are not local to tables, so the command is simply DROP TRIGGER name.
