SPI_connect
SPI_connect, SPI_connect_ext — connect a C function to the SPI manager


Synopsis

int SPI_connect(void)


int SPI_connect_ext(int options)



Description
SPI_connect opens a connection from a C function invocation to the SPI manager. You must call this function if you want to execute commands through SPI. Some utility SPI functions can be called from unconnected C functions.
SPI_connect_ext does the same but has an argument that allows passing option flags. Currently, the following option values are available:


SPI_OPT_NONATOMIC

Sets the SPI connection to be nonatomic, which means that transaction control calls (SPI_commit, SPI_rollback) are allowed. Otherwise, calling those functions will result in an immediate error.



SPI_connect() is equivalent to SPI_connect_ext(0).


Return Value


SPI_OK_CONNECT

on success

SPI_ERROR_CONNECT

on error
