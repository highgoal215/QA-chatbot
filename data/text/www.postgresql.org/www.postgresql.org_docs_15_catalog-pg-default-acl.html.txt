53.17. pg_default_acl



The catalog pg_default_acl stores initial privileges to be assigned to newly created objects.

Table 53.17. pg_default_acl Columns








Column Type
Description






oid oid
Row identifier




defaclrole oid (references pg_authid.oid)
The OID of the role associated with this entry




defaclnamespace oid (references pg_namespace.oid)
The OID of the namespace associated with this entry, or zero if none




defaclobjtype char
Type of object this entry is for: r = relation (table, view), S = sequence, f = function, T = type, n = schema




defaclacl aclitem[]
Access privileges that this type of object should have on creation






A pg_default_acl entry shows the initial privileges to be assigned to an object belonging to the indicated user. There are currently two types of entry: “global” entries with defaclnamespace = zero, and “per-schema” entries that reference a particular schema. If a global entry is present then it overrides the normal hard-wired default privileges for the object type. A per-schema entry, if present, represents privileges to be added to the global or hard-wired default privileges.
Note that when an ACL entry in another catalog is null, it is taken to represent the hard-wired default privileges for its object, not whatever might be in pg_default_acl at the moment. pg_default_acl is only consulted during object creation.
