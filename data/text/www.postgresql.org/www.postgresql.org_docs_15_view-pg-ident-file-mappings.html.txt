54.10. pg_ident_file_mappings



The view pg_ident_file_mappings provides a summary of the contents of the client user name mapping configuration file, pg_ident.conf. A row appears in this view for each non-empty, non-comment line in the file, with annotations indicating whether the map could be applied successfully.
This view can be helpful for checking whether planned changes in the authentication configuration file will work, or for diagnosing a previous failure. Note that this view reports on the current contents of the file, not on what was last loaded by the server.
By default, the pg_ident_file_mappings view can be read only by superusers.
