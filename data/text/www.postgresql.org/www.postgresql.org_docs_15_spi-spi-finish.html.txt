SPI_finish
SPI_finish — disconnect a C function from the SPI manager


Synopsis

int SPI_finish(void)



Description
SPI_finish closes an existing connection to the SPI manager. You must call this function after completing the SPI operations needed during your C function's current invocation. You do not need to worry about making this happen, however, if you abort the transaction via elog(ERROR). In that case SPI will clean itself up automatically.


Return Value


SPI_OK_FINISH

if properly disconnected

SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED

if called from an unconnected C function
