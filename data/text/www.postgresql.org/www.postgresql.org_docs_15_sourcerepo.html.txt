Appendix I. The Source Code Repository




Table of Contents

I.1. Getting the Source via Git


The PostgreSQL source code is stored and managed using the Git version control system. A public mirror of the master repository is available; it is updated within a minute of any change to the master repository.
Our wiki, https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Working_with_Git, has some discussion on working with Git.
Note that building PostgreSQL from the source repository requires reasonably up-to-date versions of bison, flex, and Perl. These tools are not needed to build from a distribution tarball, because the files that these tools are used to build are included in the tarball. Other tool requirements are the same as shown in Section 17.2.
