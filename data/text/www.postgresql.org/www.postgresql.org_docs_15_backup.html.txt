As with everything that contains valuable data, PostgreSQL databases should be backed up regularly. While the procedure is essentially simple, it is important to have a clear understanding of the underlying techniques and assumptions.

SQL dump


File system level backup


Continuous archiving



Each has its own strengths and weaknesses; each is discussed in turn in the following sections.
