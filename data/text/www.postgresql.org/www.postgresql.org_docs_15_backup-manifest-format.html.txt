Chapter 76. Backup Manifest Format




Table of Contents

76.1. Backup Manifest Top-level Object
76.2. Backup Manifest File Object
76.3. Backup Manifest WAL Range Object


The backup manifest generated by pg_basebackup is primarily intended to permit the backup to be verified using pg_verifybackup. However, it is also possible for other tools to read the backup manifest file and use the information contained therein for their own purposes. To that end, this chapter describes the format of the backup manifest file.
A backup manifest is a JSON document encoded as UTF-8. (Although in general JSON documents are required to be Unicode, PostgreSQL permits the json and jsonb data types to be used with any supported server encoding. There is no similar exception for backup manifests.) The JSON document is always an object; the keys that are present in this object are described in the next section.
