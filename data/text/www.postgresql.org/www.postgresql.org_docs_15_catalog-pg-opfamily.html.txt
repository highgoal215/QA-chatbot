53.35. pg_opfamily



The catalog pg_opfamily defines operator families. Each operator family is a collection of operators and associated support routines that implement the semantics specified for a particular index access method. Furthermore, the operators in a family are all “compatible”, in a way that is specified by the access method. The operator family concept allows cross-data-type operators to be used with indexes and to be reasoned about using knowledge of access method semantics.
Operator families are described at length in Section 38.16.

Table 53.35. pg_opfamily Columns








Column Type
Description






oid oid
Row identifier




opfmethod oid (references pg_am.oid)
Index access method operator family is for




opfname name
Name of this operator family




opfnamespace oid (references pg_namespace.oid)
Namespace of this operator family




opfowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
Owner of the operator family






The majority of the information defining an operator family is not in its pg_opfamily row, but in the associated rows in pg_amop, pg_amproc, and pg_opclass.
