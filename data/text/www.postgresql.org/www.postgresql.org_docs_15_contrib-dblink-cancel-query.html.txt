dblink_cancel_query
dblink_cancel_query — cancels any active query on the named connection


Synopsis

dblink_cancel_query(text connname) returns text



Description
dblink_cancel_query attempts to cancel any query that is in progress on the named connection. Note that this is not certain to succeed (since, for example, the remote query might already have finished). A cancel request simply improves the odds that the query will fail soon. You must still complete the normal query protocol, for example by calling dblink_get_result.


Arguments


connname

Name of the connection to use.





Return Value
Returns OK if the cancel request has been sent, or the text of an error message on failure.


Examples

SELECT dblink_cancel_query('dtest1');
