O.1. recovery.conf file merged into postgresql.conf



PostgreSQL 11 and below used a configuration file named recovery.conf  to manage replicas and standbys. Support for this file was removed in PostgreSQL 12. See the release notes for PostgreSQL 12 for details on this change.
On PostgreSQL 12 and above, archive recovery, streaming replication, and PITR are configured using normal server configuration parameters. These are set in postgresql.conf or via ALTER SYSTEM like any other parameter.
The server will not start if a recovery.conf exists.
The trigger_file  setting has been renamed to promote_trigger_file.
The standby_mode  setting has been removed. A standby.signal file in the data directory is used instead. See Standby Server Operation for details.
