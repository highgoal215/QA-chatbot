DROP DOMAIN
DROP DOMAIN — remove a domain


Synopsis

DROP DOMAIN [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP DOMAIN removes a domain. Only the owner of a domain can remove it.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the domain does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing domain.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the domain (such as table columns), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the domain if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
To remove the domain box:

DROP DOMAIN box;



Compatibility
This command conforms to the SQL standard, except for the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
