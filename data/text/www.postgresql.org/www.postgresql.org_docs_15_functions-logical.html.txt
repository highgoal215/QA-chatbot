9.1. Logical Operators



The usual logical operators are available:      

boolean AND boolean → boolean
boolean OR boolean → boolean
NOT boolean → boolean

SQL uses a three-valued logic system with true, false, and null, which represents “unknown”. Observe the following truth tables:










a
b
a AND b
a OR b




TRUE
TRUE
TRUE
TRUE


TRUE
FALSE
FALSE
TRUE


TRUE
NULL
NULL
TRUE


FALSE
FALSE
FALSE
FALSE


FALSE
NULL
FALSE
NULL


NULL
NULL
NULL
NULL












a
NOT a




TRUE
FALSE


FALSE
TRUE


NULL
NULL




The operators AND and OR are commutative, that is, you can switch the left and right operands without affecting the result. (However, it is not guaranteed that the left operand is evaluated before the right operand. See Section 4.2.14 for more information about the order of evaluation of subexpressions.)
