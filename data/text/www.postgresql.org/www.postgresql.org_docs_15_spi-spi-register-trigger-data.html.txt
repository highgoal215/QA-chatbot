SPI_register_trigger_data
SPI_register_trigger_data — make ephemeral trigger data available in SPI queries


Synopsis

int SPI_register_trigger_data(TriggerData *tdata)



Description
SPI_register_trigger_data makes any ephemeral relations captured by a trigger available to queries planned and executed through the current SPI connection. Currently, this means the transition tables captured by an AFTER trigger defined with a REFERENCING OLD/NEW TABLE AS ... clause. This function should be called by a PL trigger handler function after connecting.


Arguments


TriggerData *tdata

the TriggerData object passed to a trigger handler function as fcinfo->context





Return Value
If the execution of the command was successful then the following (nonnegative) value will be returned:


SPI_OK_TD_REGISTER

if the captured trigger data (if any) has been successfully registered



On error, one of the following negative values is returned:


SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT

if tdata is NULL

SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED

if called from an unconnected C function

SPI_ERROR_REL_DUPLICATE

if the name of any trigger data transient relation is already registered for this connection
