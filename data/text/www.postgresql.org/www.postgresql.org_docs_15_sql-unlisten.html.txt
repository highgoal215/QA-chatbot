UNLISTEN
UNLISTEN — stop listening for a notification


Synopsis

UNLISTEN { channel | * }



Description
UNLISTEN is used to remove an existing registration for NOTIFY events. UNLISTEN cancels any existing registration of the current PostgreSQL session as a listener on the notification channel named channel. The special wildcard * cancels all listener registrations for the current session.
NOTIFY contains a more extensive discussion of the use of LISTEN and NOTIFY.


Parameters


channel

Name of a notification channel (any identifier).

*

All current listen registrations for this session are cleared.





Notes
You can unlisten something you were not listening for; no warning or error will appear.
At the end of each session, UNLISTEN * is automatically executed.
A transaction that has executed UNLISTEN cannot be prepared for two-phase commit.


Examples
To make a registration:

LISTEN virtual;
NOTIFY virtual;
Asynchronous notification "virtual" received from server process with PID 8448.

Once UNLISTEN has been executed, further NOTIFY messages will be ignored:

UNLISTEN virtual;
NOTIFY virtual;
-- no NOTIFY event is received



Compatibility
There is no UNLISTEN command in the SQL standard.
