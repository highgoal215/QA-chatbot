DROP TABLESPACE
DROP TABLESPACE — remove a tablespace


Synopsis

DROP TABLESPACE [ IF EXISTS ] name



Description
DROP TABLESPACE removes a tablespace from the system.
A tablespace can only be dropped by its owner or a superuser. The tablespace must be empty of all database objects before it can be dropped. It is possible that objects in other databases might still reside in the tablespace even if no objects in the current database are using the tablespace. Also, if the tablespace is listed in the temp_tablespaces setting of any active session, the DROP might fail due to temporary files residing in the tablespace.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the tablespace does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name of a tablespace.





Notes
DROP TABLESPACE cannot be executed inside a transaction block.


Examples
To remove tablespace mystuff from the system:

DROP TABLESPACE mystuff;



Compatibility
DROP TABLESPACE is a PostgreSQL extension.


See AlsoCREATE TABLESPACE, ALTER TABLESPACE
