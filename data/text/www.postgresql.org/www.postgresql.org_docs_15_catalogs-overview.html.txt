53.1. Overview



Table 53.1 lists the system catalogs. More detailed documentation of each catalog follows below.
Most system catalogs are copied from the template database during database creation and are thereafter database-specific. A few catalogs are physically shared across all databases in a cluster; these are noted in the descriptions of the individual catalogs.
