COMMIT PREPARED
COMMIT PREPARED — commit a transaction that was earlier prepared for two-phase commit


Synopsis

COMMIT PREPARED transaction_id



Description
COMMIT PREPARED commits a transaction that is in prepared state.


Parameters


transaction_id

The transaction identifier of the transaction that is to be committed.





Notes
To commit a prepared transaction, you must be either the same user that executed the transaction originally, or a superuser. But you do not have to be in the same session that executed the transaction.
This command cannot be executed inside a transaction block. The prepared transaction is committed immediately.
All currently available prepared transactions are listed in the pg_prepared_xacts system view.


Examples
Commit the transaction identified by the transaction identifier foobar:

COMMIT PREPARED 'foobar';



Compatibility
COMMIT PREPARED is a PostgreSQL extension. It is intended for use by external transaction management systems, some of which are covered by standards (such as X/Open XA), but the SQL side of those systems is not standardized.
