54.6. pg_cursors



The pg_cursors view lists the cursors that are currently available. Cursors can be defined in several ways:



via the DECLARE statement in SQL


via the Bind message in the frontend/backend protocol, as described in Section 55.2.3


via the Server Programming Interface (SPI), as described in Section 47.1



The pg_cursors view displays cursors created by any of these means. Cursors only exist for the duration of the transaction that defines them, unless they have been declared WITH HOLD. Therefore non-holdable cursors are only present in the view until the end of their creating transaction.

Note
Cursors are used internally to implement some of the components of PostgreSQL, such as procedural languages. Therefore, the pg_cursors view might include cursors that have not been explicitly created by the user.

is_scrollable bool
