DROP CONVERSION
DROP CONVERSION — remove a conversion


Synopsis

DROP CONVERSION [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP CONVERSION removes a previously defined conversion. To be able to drop a conversion, you must own the conversion.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the conversion does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name of the conversion. The conversion name can be schema-qualified.

CASCADERESTRICT

These key words do not have any effect, since there are no dependencies on conversions.





Examples
To drop the conversion named myname:

DROP CONVERSION myname;



Compatibility
There is no DROP CONVERSION statement in the SQL standard, but a DROP TRANSLATION statement that goes along with the CREATE TRANSLATION statement that is similar to the CREATE CONVERSION statement in PostgreSQL.
