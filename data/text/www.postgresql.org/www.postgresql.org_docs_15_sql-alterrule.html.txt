Synopsis

Parameters

table_name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table or view that the rule applies to.

new_name

The new name for the rule.





Examples
To rename an existing rule:

ALTER RULE notify_all ON emp RENAME TO notify_me;



Compatibility
ALTER RULE is a PostgreSQL language extension, as is the entire query rewrite system.
