SPI_keepplan
SPI_keepplan — save a prepared statement


Synopsis

int SPI_keepplan(SPIPlanPtr plan)



Description
SPI_keepplan saves a passed statement (prepared by SPI_prepare) so that it will not be freed by SPI_finish nor by the transaction manager. This gives you the ability to reuse prepared statements in the subsequent invocations of your C function in the current session.


Arguments


SPIPlanPtr plan

the prepared statement to be saved





Return Value
0 on success; SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT if plan is NULL or invalid


Notes
The passed-in statement is relocated to permanent storage by means of pointer adjustment (no data copying is required). If you later wish to delete it, use SPI_freeplan on it.
