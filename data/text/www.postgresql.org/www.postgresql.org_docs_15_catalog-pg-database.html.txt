53.15. pg_database



The catalog pg_database stores information about the available databases. Databases are created with the CREATE DATABASE command. Consult Chapter 23 for details about the meaning of some of the parameters.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_database is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_database per cluster, not one per database.

Table 53.15. pg_database Columns








Column Type
Description






oid oid
Row identifier




datname name
Database name




datdba oid (references pg_authid.oid)
Owner of the database, usually the user who created it




encoding int4
Character encoding for this database (pg_encoding_to_char() can translate this number to the encoding name)




datlocprovider char
Locale provider for this database: c = libc, i = icu




datistemplate bool
If true, then this database can be cloned by any user with CREATEDB privileges; if false, then only superusers or the owner of the database can clone it.




datallowconn bool
If false then no one can connect to this database. This is used to protect the template0 database from being altered.




datconnlimit int4
Sets maximum number of concurrent connections that can be made to this database. -1 means no limit.




datfrozenxid xid
All transaction IDs before this one have been replaced with a permanent (“frozen”) transaction ID in this database. This is used to track whether the database needs to be vacuumed in order to prevent transaction ID wraparound or to allow pg_xact to be shrunk. It is the minimum of the per-table pg_class.relfrozenxid values.




datminmxid xid
All multixact IDs before this one have been replaced with a transaction ID in this database. This is used to track whether the database needs to be vacuumed in order to prevent multixact ID wraparound or to allow pg_multixact to be shrunk. It is the minimum of the per-table pg_class.relminmxid values.




dattablespace oid (references pg_tablespace.oid)
The default tablespace for the database. Within this database, all tables for which pg_class.reltablespace is zero will be stored in this tablespace; in particular, all the non-shared system catalogs will be there.




datcollate text
LC_COLLATE for this database




datctype text
LC_CTYPE for this database




daticulocale text
ICU locale ID for this database




datcollversion text
Provider-specific version of the collation. This is recorded when the database is created and then checked when it is used, to detect changes in the collation definition that could lead to data corruption.




datacl aclitem[]
Access privileges; see Section 5.7 for details
