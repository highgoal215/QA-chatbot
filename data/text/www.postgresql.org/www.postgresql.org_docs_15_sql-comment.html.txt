Description
COMMENT stores a comment about a database object.
Only one comment string is stored for each object, so to modify a comment, issue a new COMMENT command for the same object. To remove a comment, write NULL in place of the text string. Comments are automatically dropped when their object is dropped.
A SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock is acquired on the object to be commented.
For most kinds of object, only the object's owner can set the comment. Roles don't have owners, so the rule for COMMENT ON ROLE is that you must be superuser to comment on a superuser role, or have the CREATEROLE privilege to comment on non-superuser roles. Likewise, access methods don't have owners either; you must be superuser to comment on an access method. Of course, a superuser can comment on anything.
Comments can be viewed using psql's \d family of commands. Other user interfaces to retrieve comments can be built atop the same built-in functions that psql uses, namely obj_description, col_description, and shobj_description (see Table 9.77).


Parameters


object_namerelation_name.column_nameaggregate_nameconstraint_namefunction_nameoperator_namepolicy_nameprocedure_nameroutine_namerule_nametrigger_name

The name of the object to be commented. Names of objects that reside in schemas (tables, functions, etc.) can be schema-qualified. When commenting on a column, relation_name must refer to a table, view, composite type, or foreign table.

table_namedomain_name

When creating a comment on a constraint, a trigger, a rule or a policy these parameters specify the name of the table or domain on which that object is defined.

source_type

The name of the source data type of the cast.

target_type

The name of the target data type of the cast.

argmode

The mode of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument: IN, OUT, INOUT, or VARIADIC. If omitted, the default is IN. Note that COMMENT does not actually pay any attention to OUT arguments, since only the input arguments are needed to determine the function's identity. So it is sufficient to list the IN, INOUT, and VARIADIC arguments.

argname

The name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. Note that COMMENT does not actually pay any attention to argument names, since only the argument data types are needed to determine the function's identity.

argtype

The data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.

large_object_oid

The OID of the large object.

left_typeright_type

The data type(s) of the operator's arguments (optionally schema-qualified). Write NONE for the missing argument of a prefix operator.

PROCEDURAL

This is a noise word.

type_name

The name of the data type of the transform.

lang_name

The name of the language of the transform.

string_literal

The new comment contents, written as a string literal.

NULL

Write NULL to drop the comment.





Notes
There is presently no security mechanism for viewing comments: any user connected to a database can see all the comments for objects in that database. For shared objects such as databases, roles, and tablespaces, comments are stored globally so any user connected to any database in the cluster can see all the comments for shared objects. Therefore, don't put security-critical information in comments.


Examples
Attach a comment to the table mytable:

COMMENT ON TABLE mytable IS 'This is my table.';

Remove it again:

COMMENT ON TABLE mytable IS NULL;
