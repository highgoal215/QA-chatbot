This chapter describes the available localization features from the point of view of the administrator. PostgreSQL supports two localization facilities:



Using the locale features of the operating system to provide locale-specific collation order, number formatting, translated messages, and other aspects. This is covered in Section 24.1 and Section 24.2.


Providing a number of different character sets to support storing text in all kinds of languages, and providing character set translation between client and server. This is covered in Section 24.3.
