54.15. pg_prepared_statements



The pg_prepared_statements view displays all the prepared statements that are available in the current session. See PREPARE for more information about prepared statements.
pg_prepared_statements contains one row for each prepared statement. Rows are added to the view when a new prepared statement is created and removed when a prepared statement is released (for example, via the DEALLOCATE command).
