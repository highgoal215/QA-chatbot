dblink_send_query
dblink_send_query — sends an async query to a remote database


Synopsis

dblink_send_query(text connname, text sql) returns int



Description
dblink_send_query sends a query to be executed asynchronously, that is, without immediately waiting for the result. There must not be an async query already in progress on the connection.
After successfully dispatching an async query, completion status can be checked with dblink_is_busy, and the results are ultimately collected with dblink_get_result. It is also possible to attempt to cancel an active async query using dblink_cancel_query.


Arguments


connname

Name of the connection to use.

sql

The SQL statement that you wish to execute in the remote database, for example select * from pg_class.





Return Value
Returns 1 if the query was successfully dispatched, 0 otherwise.


Examples

SELECT dblink_send_query('dtest1', 'SELECT * FROM foo WHERE f1 < 3');
