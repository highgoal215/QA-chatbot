68.5. Examples



The PostgreSQL source distribution includes several examples of index methods implemented using GiST. The core system currently provides text search support (indexing for tsvector and tsquery) as well as R-Tree equivalent functionality for some of the built-in geometric data types (see src/backend/access/gist/gistproc.c). The following contrib modules also contain GiST operator classes:


btree_gist

B-tree equivalent functionality for several data types

cube

Indexing for multidimensional cubes

hstore

Module for storing (key, value) pairs

intarray

RD-Tree for one-dimensional array of int4 values

ltree

Indexing for tree-like structures

pg_trgm

Text similarity using trigram matching

seg

Indexing for “float ranges”
