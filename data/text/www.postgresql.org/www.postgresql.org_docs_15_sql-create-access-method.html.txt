CREATE ACCESS METHOD
CREATE ACCESS METHOD — define a new access method


Synopsis

CREATE ACCESS METHOD name
    TYPE access_method_type
    HANDLER handler_function



Description
CREATE ACCESS METHOD creates a new access method.
The access method name must be unique within the database.
Only superusers can define new access methods.


Parameters


name

The name of the access method to be created.

access_method_type

This clause specifies the type of access method to define. Only TABLE and INDEX are supported at present.

handler_function

handler_function is the name (possibly schema-qualified) of a previously registered function that represents the access method. The handler function must be declared to take a single argument of type internal, and its return type depends on the type of access method; for TABLE access methods, it must be table_am_handler and for INDEX access methods, it must be index_am_handler. The C-level API that the handler function must implement varies depending on the type of access method. The table access method API is described in Chapter 63 and the index access method API is described in Chapter 64.





Examples
Create an index access method heptree with handler function heptree_handler:

CREATE ACCESS METHOD heptree TYPE INDEX HANDLER heptree_handler;



Compatibility
CREATE ACCESS METHOD is a PostgreSQL extension.
