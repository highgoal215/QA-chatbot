54.5. pg_config



The view pg_config describes the compile-time configuration parameters of the currently installed version of PostgreSQL. It is intended, for example, to be used by software packages that want to interface to PostgreSQL to facilitate finding the required header files and libraries. It provides the same basic information as the pg_config PostgreSQL client application.
By default, the pg_config view can be read only by superusers.
