DROP TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION
DROP TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION — remove a text search configuration


Synopsis

DROP TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION drops an existing text search configuration. To execute this command you must be the owner of the configuration.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the text search configuration does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing text search configuration.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the text search configuration, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the text search configuration if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
Remove the text search configuration my_english:

DROP TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION my_english;

This command will not succeed if there are any existing indexes that reference the configuration in to_tsvector calls. Add CASCADE to drop such indexes along with the text search configuration.


Compatibility
There is no DROP TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION statement in the SQL standard.
