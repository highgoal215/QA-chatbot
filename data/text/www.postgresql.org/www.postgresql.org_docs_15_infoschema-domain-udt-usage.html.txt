37.22. domain_udt_usage



The view domain_udt_usage identifies all domains that are based on data types owned by a currently enabled role. Note that in PostgreSQL, built-in data types behave like user-defined types, so they are included here as well.

udt_catalog sql_identifier
Name of the database that the domain data type is defined in (always the current database)




udt_schema sql_identifier
