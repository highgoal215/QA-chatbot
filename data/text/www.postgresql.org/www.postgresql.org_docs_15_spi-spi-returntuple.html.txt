SPI_returntuple
SPI_returntuple — prepare to return a tuple as a Datum


Synopsis

HeapTupleHeader SPI_returntuple(HeapTuple row, TupleDesc rowdesc)



Description
SPI_returntuple makes a copy of a row in the upper executor context, returning it in the form of a row type Datum. The returned pointer need only be converted to Datum via PointerGetDatum before returning.
This function can only be used while connected to SPI. Otherwise, it returns NULL and sets SPI_result to SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED.
Note that this should be used for functions that are declared to return composite types. It is not used for triggers; use SPI_copytuple for returning a modified row in a trigger.


Arguments


HeapTuple row

row to be copied

TupleDesc rowdesc

descriptor for row (pass the same descriptor each time for most effective caching)





Return Value
HeapTupleHeader pointing to copied row, or NULL on error (see SPI_result for an error indication)
