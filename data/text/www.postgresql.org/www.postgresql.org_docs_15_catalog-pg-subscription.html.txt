53.54. pg_subscription



The catalog pg_subscription contains all existing logical replication subscriptions. For more information about logical replication see Chapter 31.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_subscription is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_subscription per cluster, not one per database.
Access to the column subconninfo is revoked from normal users, because it could contain plain-text passwords.
