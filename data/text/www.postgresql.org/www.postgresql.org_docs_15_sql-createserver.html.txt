CREATE SERVER
CREATE SERVER — define a new foreign server


Synopsis

CREATE SERVER [ IF NOT EXISTS ] server_name [ TYPE 'server_type' ] [ VERSION 'server_version' ]
    FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER fdw_name
    [ OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] ) ]



Description
CREATE SERVER defines a new foreign server. The user who defines the server becomes its owner.
A foreign server typically encapsulates connection information that a foreign-data wrapper uses to access an external data resource. Additional user-specific connection information may be specified by means of user mappings.
The server name must be unique within the database.
Creating a server requires USAGE privilege on the foreign-data wrapper being used.


Parameters


IF NOT EXISTS

Do not throw an error if a server with the same name already exists. A notice is issued in this case. Note that there is no guarantee that the existing server is anything like the one that would have been created.

server_name

The name of the foreign server to be created.

server_type

Optional server type, potentially useful to foreign-data wrappers.

server_version

Optional server version, potentially useful to foreign-data wrappers.

fdw_name

The name of the foreign-data wrapper that manages the server.

OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] )

This clause specifies the options for the server. The options typically define the connection details of the server, but the actual names and values are dependent on the server's foreign-data wrapper.





Notes
When using the dblink module, a foreign server's name can be used as an argument of the dblink_connect function to indicate the connection parameters. It is necessary to have the USAGE privilege on the foreign server to be able to use it in this way.


Examples
Create a server myserver that uses the foreign-data wrapper postgres_fdw:

CREATE SERVER myserver FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (host 'foo', dbname 'foodb', port '5432');

See postgres_fdw for more details.


Compatibility
CREATE SERVER conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED).
