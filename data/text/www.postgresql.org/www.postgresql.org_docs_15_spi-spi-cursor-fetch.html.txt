SPI_cursor_fetch — fetch some rows from a cursor


Synopsis

void SPI_cursor_fetch(Portal portal, bool forward, long count)

Arguments


Portal portal

portal containing the cursor

bool forward

true for fetch forward, false for fetch backward

long count

maximum number of rows to fetch





Return Value
SPI_processed and SPI_tuptable are set as in SPI_execute if successful.


Notes
Fetching backward may fail if the cursor's plan was not created with the CURSOR_OPT_SCROLL option.
