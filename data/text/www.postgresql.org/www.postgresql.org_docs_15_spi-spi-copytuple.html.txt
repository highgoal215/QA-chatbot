SPI_copytuple
SPI_copytuple — make a copy of a row in the upper executor context


Synopsis

HeapTuple SPI_copytuple(HeapTuple row)



Description
SPI_copytuple makes a copy of a row in the upper executor context. This is normally used to return a modified row from a trigger. In a function declared to return a composite type, use SPI_returntuple instead.
This function can only be used while connected to SPI. Otherwise, it returns NULL and sets SPI_result to SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED.


Arguments


HeapTuple row

row to be copied





Return Value
the copied row, or NULL on error (see SPI_result for an error indication)
