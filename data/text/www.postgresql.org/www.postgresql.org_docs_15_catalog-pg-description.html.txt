53.19. pg_description



The catalog pg_description stores optional descriptions (comments) for each database object. Descriptions can be manipulated with the COMMENT command and viewed with psql's \d commands. Descriptions of many built-in system objects are provided in the initial contents of pg_description.
See also pg_shdescription, which performs a similar function for descriptions involving objects that are shared across a database cluster.
