CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION
CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION — define a new text search configuration


Synopsis

CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION name (
    PARSER = parser_name |
    COPY = source_config
)



Description
CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION creates a new text search configuration. A text search configuration specifies a text search parser that can divide a string into tokens, plus dictionaries that can be used to determine which tokens are of interest for searching.
If only the parser is specified, then the new text search configuration initially has no mappings from token types to dictionaries, and therefore will ignore all words. Subsequent ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION commands must be used to create mappings to make the configuration useful. Alternatively, an existing text search configuration can be copied.
If a schema name is given then the text search configuration is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema.
The user who defines a text search configuration becomes its owner.
Refer to Chapter 12 for further information.


Parameters


name

The name of the text search configuration to be created. The name can be schema-qualified.

parser_name

The name of the text search parser to use for this configuration.

source_config

The name of an existing text search configuration to copy.





Notes
The PARSER and COPY options are mutually exclusive, because when an existing configuration is copied, its parser selection is copied too.


Compatibility
There is no CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION statement in the SQL standard.
