void SPI_scroll_cursor_fetch(Portal portal, FetchDirection direction,
                             long count)



Description
SPI_scroll_cursor_fetch fetches some rows from a cursor. This is equivalent to the SQL command FETCH.

FetchDirection direction

one of FETCH_FORWARD, FETCH_BACKWARD, FETCH_ABSOLUTE or FETCH_RELATIVE

long count

See the SQL FETCH command for details of the interpretation of the direction and count parameters.
Direction values other than FETCH_FORWARD may fail if the cursor's plan was not created with the CURSOR_OPT_SCROLL option.
