Synopsis

OPEN cursor_name
OPEN cursor_name USING value [, ... ]
OPEN cursor_name USING SQL DESCRIPTOR descriptor_name

Parameters


cursor_name

The name of the cursor to be opened. This can be an SQL identifier or a host variable.

value

A value to be bound to a placeholder in the cursor. This can be an SQL constant, a host variable, or a host variable with indicator.

descriptor_name

The name of a descriptor containing values to be bound to the placeholders in the cursor. This can be an SQL identifier or a host variable.





Examples

EXEC SQL OPEN a;
EXEC SQL OPEN d USING 1, 'test';
EXEC SQL OPEN c1 USING SQL DESCRIPTOR mydesc;
EXEC SQL OPEN :curname1;



Compatibility
OPEN is specified in the SQL standard.
