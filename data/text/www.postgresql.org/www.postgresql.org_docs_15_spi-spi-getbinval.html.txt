SPI_getbinval
SPI_getbinval — return the binary value of the specified column


Synopsis

Datum SPI_getbinval(HeapTuple row, TupleDesc rowdesc, int colnumber,
                    bool * isnull)



Description
SPI_getbinval returns the value of the specified column in the internal form (as type Datum).
This function does not allocate new space for the datum. In the case of a pass-by-reference data type, the return value will be a pointer into the passed row.


Arguments


HeapTuple row

input row to be examined

TupleDesc rowdesc

input row description

int colnumber

column number (count starts at 1)

bool * isnull

flag for a null value in the column





Return Value
The binary value of the column is returned. The variable pointed to by isnull is set to true if the column is null, else to false.
SPI_result is set to SPI_ERROR_NOATTRIBUTE on error.
