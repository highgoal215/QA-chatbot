dblink_disconnect — closes a persistent connection to a remote database


Synopsis

dblink_disconnect() returns text
dblink_disconnect(text connname) returns text



Description
dblink_disconnect() closes a connection previously opened by dblink_connect(). The form with no arguments closes an unnamed connection.


Arguments


connname

Return Value

 OK
(1 row)

SELECT dblink_disconnect('myconn');
 dblink_disconnect
-------------------
 OK
(1 row)
