reindexdb
reindexdb — reindex a PostgreSQL database


Synopsis

reindexdb [connection-option...] [option...] [ -S | --schema schema ] ... [ -t | --table table ] ... [ -i | --index index ] ... [dbname]


reindexdb [connection-option...] [option...] -a | --all


reindexdb [connection-option...] [option...] -s | --system [dbname]



Description
reindexdb is a utility for rebuilding indexes in a PostgreSQL database.
reindexdb is a wrapper around the SQL command REINDEX. There is no effective difference between reindexing databases via this utility and via other methods for accessing the server.


Options
reindexdb accepts the following command-line arguments:


-a--all

Reindex all databases.

--concurrently

Use the CONCURRENTLY option. See REINDEX, where all the caveats of this option are explained in detail.

[-d] dbname[--dbname=]dbname

Specifies the name of the database to be reindexed, when -a/--all is not used. If this is not specified, the database name is read from the environment variable PGDATABASE. If that is not set, the user name specified for the connection is used. The dbname can be a connection string. If so, connection string parameters will override any conflicting command line options.

-e--echo

Echo the commands that reindexdb generates and sends to the server.

-i index--index=index

Recreate index only. Multiple indexes can be recreated by writing multiple -i switches.

-j njobs--jobs=njobs

Execute the reindex commands in parallel by running njobs commands simultaneously. This option may reduce the processing time but it also increases the load on the database server.
reindexdb will open njobs connections to the database, so make sure your max_connections setting is high enough to accommodate all connections.
Note that this option is incompatible with the --index and --system options.

-q--quiet

Do not display progress messages.

-s--system

Reindex database's system catalogs only.

-S schema--schema=schema

Reindex schema only. Multiple schemas can be reindexed by writing multiple -S switches.

-t table--table=table

Reindex table only. Multiple tables can be reindexed by writing multiple -t switches.

--tablespace=tablespace

Specifies the tablespace where indexes are rebuilt. (This name is processed as a double-quoted identifier.)

-v--verbose

Print detailed information during processing.

-V--version

Print the reindexdb version and exit.

-?--help

Show help about reindexdb command line arguments, and exit.



reindexdb also accepts the following command-line arguments for connection parameters:


-h host--host=host

Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain socket.

-p port--port=port

Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is listening for connections.

-U username--username=username

User name to connect as.

-w--no-password

Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password.

-W--password

Force reindexdb to prompt for a password before connecting to a database.
This option is never essential, since reindexdb will automatically prompt for a password if the server demands password authentication. However, reindexdb will waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the extra connection attempt.

--maintenance-db=dbname

Specifies the name of the database to connect to to discover which databases should be reindexed, when -a/--all is used. If not specified, the postgres database will be used, or if that does not exist, template1 will be used. This can be a connection string. If so, connection string parameters will override any conflicting command line options. Also, connection string parameters other than the database name itself will be re-used when connecting to other databases.





Environment


PGDATABASEPGHOSTPGPORTPGUSER

Default connection parameters

PG_COLOR

Specifies whether to use color in diagnostic messages. Possible values are always, auto and never.



This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables supported by libpq (see Section 34.15).


Diagnostics
In case of difficulty, see REINDEX and psql for discussions of potential problems and error messages. The database server must be running at the targeted host. Also, any default connection settings and environment variables used by the libpq front-end library will apply.


Notes
reindexdb might need to connect several times to the PostgreSQL server, asking for a password each time. It is convenient to have a ~/.pgpass file in such cases. See Section 34.16 for more information.


Examples
To reindex the database test:

$ reindexdb test

To reindex the table foo and the index bar in a database named abcd:

$ reindexdb --table=foo --index=bar abcd
