MOVE
MOVE — position a cursor


Synopsis

MOVE [ direction ] [ FROM | IN ] cursor_name

where direction can be one of:

    NEXT
    PRIOR
    FIRST
    LAST
    ABSOLUTE count
    RELATIVE count
    count
    ALL
    FORWARD
    FORWARD count
    FORWARD ALL
    BACKWARD
    BACKWARD count
    BACKWARD ALL



Description
MOVE repositions a cursor without retrieving any data. MOVE works exactly like the FETCH command, except it only positions the cursor and does not return rows.
The parameters for the MOVE command are identical to those of the FETCH command; refer to FETCH for details on syntax and usage.


Outputs
On successful completion, a MOVE command returns a command tag of the form

MOVE count

The count is the number of rows that a FETCH command with the same parameters would have returned (possibly zero).


Examples

BEGIN WORK;
DECLARE liahona CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM films;

-- Skip the first 5 rows:
MOVE FORWARD 5 IN liahona;
MOVE 5

-- Fetch the 6th row from the cursor liahona:
FETCH 1 FROM liahona;
 code  | title  | did | date_prod  |  kind  |  len
-------+--------+-----+------------+--------+-------
 P_303 | 48 Hrs | 103 | 1982-10-22 | Action | 01:37
(1 row)

-- Close the cursor liahona and end the transaction:
CLOSE liahona;
COMMIT WORK;



Compatibility
There is no MOVE statement in the SQL standard.
