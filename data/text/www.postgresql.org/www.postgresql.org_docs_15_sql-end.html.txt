END
END — commit the current transaction


Synopsis

END [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ AND [ NO ] CHAIN ]



Description
END commits the current transaction. All changes made by the transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable if a crash occurs. This command is a PostgreSQL extension that is equivalent to COMMIT.


Parameters


WORKTRANSACTION

Optional key words. They have no effect.

AND CHAIN

If AND CHAIN is specified, a new transaction is immediately started with the same transaction characteristics (see SET TRANSACTION) as the just finished one. Otherwise, no new transaction is started.





Notes
Use ROLLBACK to abort a transaction.
Issuing END when not inside a transaction does no harm, but it will provoke a warning message.


Examples
To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:

END;



Compatibility
END is a PostgreSQL extension that provides functionality equivalent to COMMIT, which is specified in the SQL standard.
