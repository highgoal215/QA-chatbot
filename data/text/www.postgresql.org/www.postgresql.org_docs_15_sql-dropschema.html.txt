DROP SCHEMA

SQL Commands

DROP SCHEMA
DROP SCHEMA — remove a schema


Synopsis

DROP SCHEMA [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP SCHEMA removes schemas from the database.
A schema can only be dropped by its owner or a superuser. Note that the owner can drop the schema (and thereby all contained objects) even if they do not own some of the objects within the schema.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the schema does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name of a schema.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects (tables, functions, etc.) that are contained in the schema, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the schema if it contains any objects. This is the default.





Notes
Using the CASCADE option might make the command remove objects in other schemas besides the one(s) named.


Examples
To remove schema mystuff from the database, along with everything it contains:

DROP SCHEMA mystuff CASCADE;



Compatibility
DROP SCHEMA is fully conforming with the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one schema to be dropped per command, and apart from the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
