Chapter 75. How the Planner Uses Statistics




Table of Contents

75.1. Row Estimation Examples
75.2. Multivariate Statistics Examples


75.2.1. Functional Dependencies
75.2.2. Multivariate N-Distinct Counts
75.2.3. MCV Lists


75.3. Planner Statistics and Security


This chapter builds on the material covered in Section 14.1 and Section 14.2 to show some additional details about how the planner uses the system statistics to estimate the number of rows each part of a query might return. This is a significant part of the planning process, providing much of the raw material for cost calculation.
The intent of this chapter is not to document the code in detail, but to present an overview of how it works. This will perhaps ease the learning curve for someone who subsequently wishes to read the code.
