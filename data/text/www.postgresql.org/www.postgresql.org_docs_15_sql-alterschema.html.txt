ALTER SCHEMA
ALTER SCHEMA — change the definition of a schema


Synopsis

ALTER SCHEMA name RENAME TO new_name
ALTER SCHEMA name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }



Description
ALTER SCHEMA changes the definition of a schema.
You must own the schema to use ALTER SCHEMA. To rename a schema you must also have the CREATE privilege for the database. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and you must have the CREATE privilege for the database. (Note that superusers have all these privileges automatically.)


Parameters


name

The name of an existing schema.

new_name

The new name of the schema. The new name cannot begin with pg_, as such names are reserved for system schemas.

new_owner

The new owner of the schema.





Compatibility
There is no ALTER SCHEMA statement in the SQL standard.
