37.61. user_mapping_options



The view user_mapping_options contains all the options defined for user mappings in the current database. Only those user mappings are shown where the current user has access to the corresponding foreign server (by way of being the owner or having some privilege).

Table 37.59. user_mapping_options Columns








Column Type
Description






authorization_identifier sql_identifier
Name of the user being mapped, or PUBLIC if the mapping is public




foreign_server_catalog sql_identifier
Name of the database that the foreign server used by this mapping is defined in (always the current database)




foreign_server_name sql_identifier
Name of the foreign server used by this mapping




option_name sql_identifier
Name of an option




option_value character_data
Value of the option. This column will show as null unless the current user is the user being mapped, or the mapping is for PUBLIC and the current user is the server owner, or the current user is a superuser. The intent is to protect password information stored as user mapping option.
