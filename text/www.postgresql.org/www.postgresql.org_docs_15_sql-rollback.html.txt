ROLLBACK
ROLLBACK — abort the current transaction


Synopsis

ROLLBACK [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ AND [ NO ] CHAIN ]



Description
ROLLBACK rolls back the current transaction and causes all the updates made by the transaction to be discarded.


Parameters


WORKTRANSACTION

Optional key words. They have no effect.

AND CHAIN

If AND CHAIN is specified, a new transaction is immediately started with the same transaction characteristics (see SET TRANSACTION) as the just finished one. Otherwise, no new transaction is started.





Notes
Use COMMIT to successfully terminate a transaction.
Issuing ROLLBACK outside of a transaction block emits a warning and otherwise has no effect. ROLLBACK AND CHAIN outside of a transaction block is an error.


Examples
To abort all changes:

ROLLBACK;



Compatibility
The command ROLLBACK conforms to the SQL standard. The form ROLLBACK TRANSACTION is a PostgreSQL extension.
