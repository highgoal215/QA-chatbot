1.  What Is PostgreSQL?



PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) based on POSTGRES, Version 4.2, developed at the University of California at Berkeley Computer Science Department. POSTGRES pioneered many concepts that only became available in some commercial database systems much later.
PostgreSQL is an open-source descendant of this original Berkeley code. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and offers many modern features:


complex queries
foreign keys
triggers
updatable views
transactional integrity
multiversion concurrency control


Also, PostgreSQL can be extended by the user in many ways, for example by adding new


data types
functions
operators
aggregate functions
index methods
procedural languages


And because of the liberal license, PostgreSQL can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone free of charge for any purpose, be it private, commercial, or academic.
