The view pg_timezone_abbrevs provides a list of time zone abbreviations that are currently recognized by the datetime input routines. The contents of this view change when the timezone_abbreviations run-time parameter is modified.

Column Type
Description






abbrev text
Time zone abbreviation




utc_offset interval
Offset from UTC (positive means east of Greenwich)

While most timezone abbreviations represent fixed offsets from UTC, there are some that have historically varied in value (see Section B.4 for more information). In such cases this view presents their current meaning.
