53.58. pg_trigger



The catalog pg_trigger stores triggers on tables and views. See CREATE TRIGGER for more information.

Table 53.58. pg_trigger Columns








Column Type
Description






oid oid
Row identifier




tgrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
The table this trigger is on




tgparentid oid (references pg_trigger.oid)
Parent trigger that this trigger is cloned from (this happens when partitions are created or attached to a partitioned table); zero if not a clone




tgname name
Trigger name (must be unique among triggers of same table)




tgfoid oid (references pg_proc.oid)
The function to be called




tgtype int2
Bit mask identifying trigger firing conditions




tgenabled char
Controls in which session_replication_role modes the trigger fires. O = trigger fires in “origin” and “local” modes, D = trigger is disabled, R = trigger fires in “replica” mode, A = trigger fires always.




tgisinternal bool
True if trigger is internally generated (usually, to enforce the constraint identified by tgconstraint)




tgconstrrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
The table referenced by a referential integrity constraint (zero if trigger is not for a referential integrity constraint)




tgconstrindid oid (references pg_class.oid)
The index supporting a unique, primary key, referential integrity, or exclusion constraint (zero if trigger is not for one of these types of constraint)




tgconstraint oid (references pg_constraint.oid)
The pg_constraint entry associated with the trigger (zero if trigger is not for a constraint)




tgdeferrable bool
True if constraint trigger is deferrable




tginitdeferred bool
True if constraint trigger is initially deferred




tgnargs int2
Number of argument strings passed to trigger function




tgattr int2vector (references pg_attribute.attnum)
Column numbers, if trigger is column-specific; otherwise an empty array




tgargs bytea
Argument strings to pass to trigger, each NULL-terminated




tgqual pg_node_tree
Expression tree (in nodeToString() representation) for the trigger's WHEN condition, or null if none




tgoldtable name
REFERENCING clause name for OLD TABLE, or null if none




tgnewtable name
REFERENCING clause name for NEW TABLE, or null if none






Currently, column-specific triggering is supported only for UPDATE events, and so tgattr is relevant only for that event type. tgtype might contain bits for other event types as well, but those are presumed to be table-wide regardless of what is in tgattr.

Note
When tgconstraint is nonzero, tgconstrrelid, tgconstrindid, tgdeferrable, and tginitdeferred are largely redundant with the referenced pg_constraint entry. However, it is possible for a non-deferrable trigger to be associated with a deferrable constraint: foreign key constraints can have some deferrable and some non-deferrable triggers.


Note
pg_class.relhastriggers must be true if a relation has any triggers in this catalog.
