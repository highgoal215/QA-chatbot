49.7. Logical Decoding Output Writers



It is possible to add more output methods for logical decoding. For details, see src/backend/replication/logical/logicalfuncs.c. Essentially, three functions need to be provided: one to read WAL, one to prepare writing output, and one to write the output (see Section 49.6.5).
