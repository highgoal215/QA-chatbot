DROP CAST — remove a cast


Synopsis

DROP CAST [ IF EXISTS ] (source_type AS target_type) [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP CAST removes a previously defined cast.
To be able to drop a cast, you must own the source or the target data type. These are the same privileges that are required to create a cast.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the cast does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

source_type

The name of the source data type of the cast.

target_type

The name of the target data type of the cast.

CASCADERESTRICT

These key words do not have any effect, since there are no dependencies on casts.





Examples
To drop the cast from type text to type int:

DROP CAST (text AS int);



Compatibility
The DROP CAST command conforms to the SQL standard.
