O.4. pg_resetxlog renamed to pg_resetwal



PostgreSQL 9.6 and below provided a command named pg_resetxlog  to reset the write-ahead-log (WAL) files. This command was renamed to pg_resetwal, see pg_resetwal for documentation of pg_resetwal and see the release notes for PostgreSQL 10 for details on this change.
