ALTER OPERATOR
ALTER OPERATOR — change the definition of an operator


Synopsis

ALTER OPERATOR name ( { left_type | NONE } , right_type )
    OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }

ALTER OPERATOR name ( { left_type | NONE } , right_type )
    SET SCHEMA new_schema

ALTER OPERATOR name ( { left_type | NONE } , right_type )
    SET ( {  RESTRICT = { res_proc | NONE }
           | JOIN = { join_proc | NONE }
         } [, ... ] )



Description
ALTER OPERATOR changes the definition of an operator.
You must own the operator to use ALTER OPERATOR. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on the operator's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the operator. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any operator anyway.)


Parameters


name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator.

left_type

The data type of the operator's left operand; write NONE if the operator has no left operand.

right_type

The data type of the operator's right operand.

new_owner

The new owner of the operator.

new_schema

The new schema for the operator.

res_proc

The restriction selectivity estimator function for this operator; write NONE to remove existing selectivity estimator.

join_proc

The join selectivity estimator function for this operator; write NONE to remove existing selectivity estimator.





Examples
Change the owner of a custom operator a @@ b for type text:

ALTER OPERATOR @@ (text, text) OWNER TO joe;

Change the restriction and join selectivity estimator functions of a custom operator a && b for type int[]:

ALTER OPERATOR && (_int4, _int4) SET (RESTRICT = _int_contsel, JOIN = _int_contjoinsel);



Compatibility
There is no ALTER OPERATOR statement in the SQL standard.
