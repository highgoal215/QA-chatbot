53.50. pg_shseclabel



The catalog pg_shseclabel stores security labels on shared database objects. Security labels can be manipulated with the SECURITY LABEL command. For an easier way to view security labels, see Section 54.22.
See also pg_seclabel, which performs a similar function for security labels involving objects within a single database.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_shseclabel is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only one copy of pg_shseclabel per cluster, not one per database.
