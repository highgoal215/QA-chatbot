CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY — define a new text search dictionary


Synopsis

CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY name (
    TEMPLATE = template
    [, option = value [, ... ]]
)



Description
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY creates a new text search dictionary. A text search dictionary specifies a way of recognizing interesting or uninteresting words for searching. A dictionary depends on a text search template, which specifies the functions that actually perform the work. Typically the dictionary provides some options that control the detailed behavior of the template's functions.
If a schema name is given then the text search dictionary is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema.
The user who defines a text search dictionary becomes its owner.
Refer to Chapter 12 for further information.


Parameters


name

The name of the text search dictionary to be created. The name can be schema-qualified.

template

The name of the text search template that will define the basic behavior of this dictionary.

option

The name of a template-specific option to be set for this dictionary.

value

The value to use for a template-specific option. If the value is not a simple identifier or number, it must be quoted (but you can always quote it, if you wish).



The options can appear in any order.


Examples
The following example command creates a Snowball-based dictionary with a nonstandard list of stop words.

CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY my_russian (
    template = snowball,
    language = russian,
    stopwords = myrussian
);



Compatibility
There is no CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY statement in the SQL standard.
