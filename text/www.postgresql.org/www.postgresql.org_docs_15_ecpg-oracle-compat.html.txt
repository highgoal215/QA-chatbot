36.16. Oracle Compatibility Mode



ecpg can be run in a so-called Oracle compatibility mode. If this mode is active, it tries to behave as if it were Oracle Pro*C.
Specifically, this mode changes ecpg in three ways:



Pad character arrays receiving character string types with trailing spaces to the specified length


Zero byte terminate these character arrays, and set the indicator variable if truncation occurs


Set the null indicator to -1 when character arrays receive empty character string types
