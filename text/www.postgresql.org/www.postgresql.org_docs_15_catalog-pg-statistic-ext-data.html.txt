53.53. pg_statistic_ext_data



The catalog pg_statistic_ext_data holds data for extended planner statistics defined in pg_statistic_ext. Each row in this catalog corresponds to a statistics object created with CREATE STATISTICS.
Normally there is one entry, with stxdinherit = false, for each statistics object that has been analyzed. If the table has inheritance children or partitions, a second entry with stxdinherit = true is also created. This row represents the statistics object over the inheritance tree, i.e., statistics for the data you'd see with SELECT * FROM table*, whereas the stxdinherit = false row represents the results of SELECT * FROM ONLY table.
Like pg_statistic, pg_statistic_ext_data should not be readable by the public, since the contents might be considered sensitive. (Example: most common combinations of values in columns might be quite interesting.) pg_stats_ext is a publicly readable view on pg_statistic_ext_data (after joining with pg_statistic_ext) that only exposes information about those tables and columns that are readable by the current user.
