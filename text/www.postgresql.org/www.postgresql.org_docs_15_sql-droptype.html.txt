DROP TYPE
DROP TYPE — remove a data type


Synopsis

DROP TYPE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP TYPE removes a user-defined data type. Only the owner of a type can remove it.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the type does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the data type to remove.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the type (such as table columns, functions, and operators), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the type if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
To remove the data type box:

DROP TYPE box;



Compatibility
This command is similar to the corresponding command in the SQL standard, apart from the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension. But note that much of the CREATE TYPE command and the data type extension mechanisms in PostgreSQL differ from the SQL standard.
