ALTER LARGE OBJECT
ALTER LARGE OBJECT — change the definition of a large object


Synopsis

ALTER LARGE OBJECT large_object_oid OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }



Description
ALTER LARGE OBJECT changes the definition of a large object.
You must own the large object to use ALTER LARGE OBJECT. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role. (However, a superuser can alter any large object anyway.) Currently, the only functionality is to assign a new owner, so both restrictions always apply.


Parameters


large_object_oid

OID of the large object to be altered

new_owner

The new owner of the large object





Compatibility
There is no ALTER LARGE OBJECT statement in the SQL standard.
