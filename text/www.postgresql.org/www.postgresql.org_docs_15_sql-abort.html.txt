ABORT
ABORT — abort the current transaction


Synopsis

ABORT [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] [ AND [ NO ] CHAIN ]



Description
ABORT rolls back the current transaction and causes all the updates made by the transaction to be discarded. This command is identical in behavior to the standard SQL command ROLLBACK, and is present only for historical reasons.


Parameters


WORKTRANSACTION

Optional key words. They have no effect.

AND CHAIN

If AND CHAIN is specified, a new transaction is immediately started with the same transaction characteristics (see SET TRANSACTION) as the just finished one. Otherwise, no new transaction is started.





Notes
Use COMMIT to successfully terminate a transaction.
Issuing ABORT outside of a transaction block emits a warning and otherwise has no effect.


Examples
To abort all changes:

ABORT;



Compatibility
This command is a PostgreSQL extension present for historical reasons. ROLLBACK is the equivalent standard SQL command.
