53.43. pg_range



The catalog pg_range stores information about range types. This is in addition to the types' entries in pg_type.

Table 53.43. pg_range Columns








Column Type
Description






rngtypid oid (references pg_type.oid)
OID of the range type




rngsubtype oid (references pg_type.oid)
OID of the element type (subtype) of this range type




rngmultitypid oid (references pg_type.oid)
OID of the multirange type for this range type




rngcollation oid (references pg_collation.oid)
OID of the collation used for range comparisons, or zero if none




rngsubopc oid (references pg_opclass.oid)
OID of the subtype's operator class used for range comparisons




rngcanonical regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
OID of the function to convert a range value into canonical form, or zero if none




rngsubdiff regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
OID of the function to return the difference between two element values as double precision, or zero if none






rngsubopc (plus rngcollation, if the element type is collatable) determines the sort ordering used by the range type. rngcanonical is used when the element type is discrete. rngsubdiff is optional but should be supplied to improve performance of GiST indexes on the range type.
