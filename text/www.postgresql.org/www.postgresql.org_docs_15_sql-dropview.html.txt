DROP VIEW
DROP VIEW — remove a view


Synopsis

DROP VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP VIEW drops an existing view. To execute this command you must be the owner of the view.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the view does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the view to remove.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the view (such as other views), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the view if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
This command will remove the view called kinds:

DROP VIEW kinds;



Compatibility
This command conforms to the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one view to be dropped per command, and apart from the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
