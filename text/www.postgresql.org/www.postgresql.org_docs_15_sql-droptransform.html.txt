DROP TRANSFORM
DROP TRANSFORM — remove a transform


Synopsis

DROP TRANSFORM [ IF EXISTS ] FOR type_name LANGUAGE lang_name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP TRANSFORM removes a previously defined transform.
To be able to drop a transform, you must own the type and the language. These are the same privileges that are required to create a transform.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the transform does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

type_name

The name of the data type of the transform.

lang_name

The name of the language of the transform.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the transform, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the transform if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
To drop the transform for type hstore and language plpython3u:

DROP TRANSFORM FOR hstore LANGUAGE plpython3u;



Compatibility
This form of DROP TRANSFORM is a PostgreSQL extension. See CREATE TRANSFORM for details.
