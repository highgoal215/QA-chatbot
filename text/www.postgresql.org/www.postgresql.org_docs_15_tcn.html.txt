F.44. tcn



The tcn module provides a trigger function that notifies listeners of changes to any table on which it is attached. It must be used as an AFTER trigger FOR EACH ROW.
This module is considered “trusted”, that is, it can be installed by non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.
Only one parameter may be supplied to the function in a CREATE TRIGGER statement, and that is optional. If supplied it will be used for the channel name for the notifications. If omitted tcn will be used for the channel name.
The payload of the notifications consists of the table name, a letter to indicate which type of operation was performed, and column name/value pairs for primary key columns. Each part is separated from the next by a comma. For ease of parsing using regular expressions, table and column names are always wrapped in double quotes, and data values are always wrapped in single quotes. Embedded quotes are doubled.
A brief example of using the extension follows.

test=# create table tcndata
test-#   (
test(#     a int not null,
test(#     b date not null,
test(#     c text,
test(#     primary key (a, b)
test(#   );
CREATE TABLE
test=# create trigger tcndata_tcn_trigger
test-#   after insert or update or delete on tcndata
test-#   for each row execute function triggered_change_notification();
CREATE TRIGGER
test=# listen tcn;
LISTEN
test=# insert into tcndata values (1, date '2012-12-22', 'one'),
test-#                            (1, date '2012-12-23', 'another'),
test-#                            (2, date '2012-12-23', 'two');
