46.11. Environment Variables



Some of the environment variables that are accepted by the Python interpreter can also be used to affect PL/Python behavior. They would need to be set in the environment of the main PostgreSQL server process, for example in a start script. The available environment variables depend on the version of Python; see the Python documentation for details. At the time of this writing, the following environment variables have an affect on PL/Python, assuming an adequate Python version:



PYTHONHOME


PYTHONPATH


PYTHONY2K


PYTHONOPTIMIZE


PYTHONDEBUG


PYTHONVERBOSE


PYTHONCASEOK


PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE


PYTHONIOENCODING


PYTHONUSERBASE


PYTHONHASHSEED



(It appears to be a Python implementation detail beyond the control of PL/Python that some of the environment variables listed on the python man page are only effective in a command-line interpreter and not an embedded Python interpreter.)
