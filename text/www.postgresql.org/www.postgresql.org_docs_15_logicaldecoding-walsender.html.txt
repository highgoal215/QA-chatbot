49.3. Streaming Replication Protocol Interface



The commands



CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT slot_name LOGICAL output_plugin


DROP_REPLICATION_SLOT slot_name [ WAIT ]


START_REPLICATION SLOT slot_name LOGICAL ...



are used to create, drop, and stream changes from a replication slot, respectively. These commands are only available over a replication connection; they cannot be used via SQL. See Section 55.4 for details on these commands.
The command pg_recvlogical can be used to control logical decoding over a streaming replication connection. (It uses these commands internally.)
