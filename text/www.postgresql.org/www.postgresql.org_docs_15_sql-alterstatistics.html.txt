ALTER STATISTICS
ALTER STATISTICS — change the definition of an extended statistics object


Synopsis

ALTER STATISTICS name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER STATISTICS name RENAME TO new_name
ALTER STATISTICS name SET SCHEMA new_schema
ALTER STATISTICS name SET STATISTICS new_target



Description
ALTER STATISTICS changes the parameters of an existing extended statistics object. Any parameters not specifically set in the ALTER STATISTICS command retain their prior settings.
You must own the statistics object to use ALTER STATISTICS. To change a statistics object's schema, you must also have CREATE privilege on the new schema. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on the statistics object's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the statistics object. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any statistics object anyway.)


Parameters


name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the statistics object to be altered.

new_owner

The user name of the new owner of the statistics object.

new_name

The new name for the statistics object.

new_schema

The new schema for the statistics object.

new_target

The statistic-gathering target for this statistics object for subsequent ANALYZE operations. The target can be set in the range 0 to 10000; alternatively, set it to -1 to revert to using the maximum of the statistics target of the referenced columns, if set, or the system default statistics target (default_statistics_target). For more information on the use of statistics by the PostgreSQL query planner, refer to Section 14.2.





Compatibility
There is no ALTER STATISTICS command in the SQL standard.
