DROP OPERATOR
DROP OPERATOR — remove an operator


Synopsis

DROP OPERATOR [ IF EXISTS ] name ( { left_type | NONE } , right_type ) [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP OPERATOR drops an existing operator from the database system. To execute this command you must be the owner of the operator.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the operator does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator.

left_type

The data type of the operator's left operand; write NONE if the operator has no left operand.

right_type

The data type of the operator's right operand.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the operator (such as views using it), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the operator if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
Remove the power operator a^b for type integer:

DROP OPERATOR ^ (integer, integer);

Remove the bitwise-complement prefix operator ~b for type bit:

DROP OPERATOR ~ (none, bit);

Remove multiple operators in one command:

DROP OPERATOR ~ (none, bit), ^ (integer, integer);



Compatibility
There is no DROP OPERATOR statement in the SQL standard.
