SPI_start_transaction
SPI_start_transaction — obsolete function


Synopsis

void SPI_start_transaction(void)



Description
SPI_start_transaction does nothing, and exists only for code compatibility with earlier PostgreSQL releases. It used to be required after calling SPI_commit or SPI_rollback, but now those functions start a new transaction automatically.
