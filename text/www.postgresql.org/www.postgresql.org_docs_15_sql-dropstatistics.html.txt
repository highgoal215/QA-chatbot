DROP STATISTICS
DROP STATISTICS — remove extended statistics


Synopsis

DROP STATISTICS [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP STATISTICS removes statistics object(s) from the database. Only the statistics object's owner, the schema owner, or a superuser can drop a statistics object.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the statistics object does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the statistics object to drop.

CASCADERESTRICT

These key words do not have any effect, since there are no dependencies on statistics.





Examples
To destroy two statistics objects in different schemas, without failing if they don't exist:

DROP STATISTICS IF EXISTS
    accounting.users_uid_creation,
    public.grants_user_role;



Compatibility
There is no DROP STATISTICS command in the SQL standard.
