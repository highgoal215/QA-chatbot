DROP FOREIGN TABLE
DROP FOREIGN TABLE — remove a foreign table


Synopsis

DROP FOREIGN TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP FOREIGN TABLE removes a foreign table. Only the owner of a foreign table can remove it.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the foreign table does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the foreign table to drop.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the foreign table (such as views), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the foreign table if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
To destroy two foreign tables, films and distributors:

DROP FOREIGN TABLE films, distributors;



Compatibility
This command conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED), except that the standard only allows one foreign table to be dropped per command, and apart from the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
