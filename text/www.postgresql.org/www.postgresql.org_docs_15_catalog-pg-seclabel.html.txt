53.46. pg_seclabel



The catalog pg_seclabel stores security labels on database objects. Security labels can be manipulated with the SECURITY LABEL command. For an easier way to view security labels, see Section 54.22.
See also pg_shseclabel, which performs a similar function for security labels of database objects that are shared across a database cluster.
