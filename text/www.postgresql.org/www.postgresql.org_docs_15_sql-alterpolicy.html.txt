ALTER POLICY
ALTER POLICY — change the definition of a row-level security policy


Synopsis

ALTER POLICY name ON table_name RENAME TO new_name

ALTER POLICY name ON table_name
    [ TO { role_name | PUBLIC | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER } [, ...] ]
    [ USING ( using_expression ) ]
    [ WITH CHECK ( check_expression ) ]



Description
ALTER POLICY changes the definition of an existing row-level security policy. Note that ALTER POLICY only allows the set of roles to which the policy applies and the USING and WITH CHECK expressions to be modified. To change other properties of a policy, such as the command to which it applies or whether it is permissive or restrictive, the policy must be dropped and recreated.
To use ALTER POLICY, you must own the table that the policy applies to.
In the second form of ALTER POLICY, the role list, using_expression, and check_expression are replaced independently if specified. When one of those clauses is omitted, the corresponding part of the policy is unchanged.


Parameters


name

The name of an existing policy to alter.

table_name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table that the policy is on.

new_name

The new name for the policy.

role_name

The role(s) to which the policy applies. Multiple roles can be specified at one time. To apply the policy to all roles, use PUBLIC.

using_expression

The USING expression for the policy. See CREATE POLICY for details.

check_expression

The WITH CHECK expression for the policy. See CREATE POLICY for details.





Compatibility
ALTER POLICY is a PostgreSQL extension.
