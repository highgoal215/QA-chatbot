9.14. UUID Functions



PostgreSQL includes one function to generate a UUID:

gen_random_uuid () → uuid

This function returns a version 4 (random) UUID. This is the most commonly used type of UUID and is appropriate for most applications.
The uuid-ossp module provides additional functions that implement other standard algorithms for generating UUIDs.
PostgreSQL also provides the usual comparison operators shown in Table 9.1 for UUIDs.
