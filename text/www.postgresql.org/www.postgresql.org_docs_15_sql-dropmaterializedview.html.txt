Description

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the materialized view to remove.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the materialized view (such as other materialized views, or regular views), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the materialized view if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
