49.4. Logical Decoding SQL Interface



See Section 9.27.6 for detailed documentation on the SQL-level API for interacting with logical decoding.
Synchronous replication (see Section 27.2.8) is only supported on replication slots used over the streaming replication interface. The function interface and additional, non-core interfaces do not support synchronous replication.
