53.27. pg_inherits



The catalog pg_inherits records information about table and index inheritance hierarchies. There is one entry for each direct parent-child table or index relationship in the database. (Indirect inheritance can be determined by following chains of entries.)

Table 53.27. pg_inherits Columns








Column Type
Description






inhrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
The OID of the child table or index




inhparent oid (references pg_class.oid)
The OID of the parent table or index




inhseqno int4
If there is more than one direct parent for a child table (multiple inheritance), this number tells the order in which the inherited columns are to be arranged. The count starts at 1.
Indexes cannot have multiple inheritance, since they can only inherit when using declarative partitioning.




inhdetachpending bool
true for a partition that is in the process of being detached; false otherwise.
