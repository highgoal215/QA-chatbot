DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY
DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY — remove a text search dictionary


Synopsis

DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]



Description
DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY drops an existing text search dictionary. To execute this command you must be the owner of the dictionary.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the text search dictionary does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing text search dictionary.

CASCADE

Automatically drop objects that depend on the text search dictionary, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see Section 5.14).

RESTRICT

Refuse to drop the text search dictionary if any objects depend on it. This is the default.





Examples
Remove the text search dictionary english:

DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english;

This command will not succeed if there are any existing text search configurations that use the dictionary. Add CASCADE to drop such configurations along with the dictionary.


Compatibility
There is no DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY statement in the SQL standard.
