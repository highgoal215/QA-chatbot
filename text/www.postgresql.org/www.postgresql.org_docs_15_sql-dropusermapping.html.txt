DROP USER MAPPING
DROP USER MAPPING — remove a user mapping for a foreign server


Synopsis

DROP USER MAPPING [ IF EXISTS ] FOR { user_name | USER | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | PUBLIC } SERVER server_name



Description
DROP USER MAPPING removes an existing user mapping from foreign server.
The owner of a foreign server can drop user mappings for that server for any user. Also, a user can drop a user mapping for their own user name if USAGE privilege on the server has been granted to the user.


Parameters


IF EXISTS

Do not throw an error if the user mapping does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

user_name

User name of the mapping. CURRENT_ROLE, CURRENT_USER, and USER match the name of the current user. PUBLIC is used to match all present and future user names in the system.

server_name

Server name of the user mapping.





Examples
Drop a user mapping bob, server foo if it exists:

DROP USER MAPPING IF EXISTS FOR bob SERVER foo;



Compatibility
DROP USER MAPPING conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED). The IF EXISTS clause is a PostgreSQL extension.
