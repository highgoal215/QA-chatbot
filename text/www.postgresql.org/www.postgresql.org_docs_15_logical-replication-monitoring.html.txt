31.8. Monitoring



Because logical replication is based on a similar architecture as physical streaming replication, the monitoring on a publication node is similar to monitoring of a physical replication primary (see Section 27.2.5.2).
The monitoring information about subscription is visible in pg_stat_subscription. This view contains one row for every subscription worker. A subscription can have zero or more active subscription workers depending on its state.
Normally, there is a single apply process running for an enabled subscription. A disabled subscription or a crashed subscription will have zero rows in this view. If the initial data synchronization of any table is in progress, there will be additional workers for the tables being synchronized.
